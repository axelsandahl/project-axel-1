## Summary

Building AI course project. My idea to solve a real world problem with AI. 

## Background

As a future university student I find it hard to get the right information about different universities, especially universities in other countries than my own (Sweden). There is no truly up-to-date website with all relevant information about universities/colleges. I want a place where it's easy to find the right statistics from all major universites/colleges. It should be easy to get an understanding of the student and day to day-life, how to apply and what qualifications that is needed.

The major problems is:
* It's hard to find relevant information about universities and colleges.
* It's hard to know how and when to apply.
* There is no easy way to get relevant information about universities/colleges outside of homecountry.

## How is it used?

A website where you can write the name of a university/college and you will get an instant description about student-life, location, short history, global and national ranking. You will also get a list of all different subject/courses that you can attend at that specific school, where you can click to get information about the specific course. The information will include ranking, number of students, entry qualifications, meritourious qualifications, chance of job whitin 1 year of graduating, normal jobs of graduates, intensity of the course, competition and when application opens and closes. 

You will also be able to choose a geographical location or other criteria such as subject, student-life, chance of a job after graduation and so on and see the highest ranking universities/colleges within your criteria. You will be able to combine different criterias such as "best university in Italy for economy".
